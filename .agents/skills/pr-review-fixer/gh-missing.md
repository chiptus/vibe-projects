# Fallback: gh is missing

Reached from `SKILL.md` only when Phase 1's `command -v gh` check comes back
empty (e.g. a remote/cloud session with no `gh` CLI, relying on the
`mcp__github__*` tools instead). Skip this file entirely when `gh` is available.

## Phase 1: fetch threads

Reconstruct the same `{threads, reviews, issueComments}` shape from
`mcp__github__pull_request_read`. This skill's `allowed-tools` grants no git
command, so don't try to derive owner/repo/PR number by shelling out: use
what you already know about the repo from this session's own context (its
scope, working directory, or what the user told you). This fallback has no
way to look up the PR number on its own: if it isn't already clear from
context, ask the user for it before making the call below.

- `method: get_review_comments` → review threads. Each has `id` (the GraphQL
  thread node ID: this is what `resolve_review_thread` below needs, keep it),
  `is_resolved`, `path`, `line`, and `comments[]` with `author`/`body`/`html_url`
  (Phase 4 needs `html_url` to build a reply, keep it too). Keep only
  `is_resolved == false` (the tool doesn't filter this for you the way the
  script's `jq` does).
- `method: get_reviews` → review bodies; keep only non-empty `body`.
- `method: get_comments` → top-level PR/issue comments (the script's
  `issueComments`).

## Phase 4: resolve and reply

- Resolve a thread with `mcp__github__resolve_review_thread`, passing the
  thread's GraphQL `id` (kept from `get_review_comments` above).
- A reply, if the user wants one posted:
  - Inline thread reply: `mcp__github__add_reply_to_pull_request_comment`
    with the numeric comment ID from the thread's comment `html_url` (the
    `#discussion_r<id>` suffix, not the thread's GraphQL `id`).
  - Top-level PR comment: `mcp__github__add_issue_comment`.
